(in first place what is the need of angular framework 
and what are the other ways of creating SPA before angular)
In the first place, what is the necessity of the Angular framework, 
and what alternative methods existed for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) 
prior to the emergence of Angular?

-
The necessity of the Angular framework arises from the need to build robust,
 maintainable, and scalable Single Page Applications (SPAs). 
 Prior to the emergence of Angular, developers used various techniques and libraries 
 to create SPAs, but they often faced challenges in terms of code organization, 
 data binding, and component-based architecture. 
 
 Some alternatives to Angular for building SPAs include:
 Vanilla JavaScript
 jQuery
 Backbone.js
 Ember.js
 React
