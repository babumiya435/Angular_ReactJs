** TypeScript fundamentals (since Angular is built with TypeScript) **

- Typescript's primary uses cases are:
    - appending types to js variables, function params, function returns.
    - static typing to js - adding implicit types to js variables, function params, function returns.
    - providing type checking in compile time.
    - used in Angular development to create SPA.
    - Angular is built with TypeScript.

- To help catch errors at compile time.
- By leveraging TypeScript's type system, Angular ensures better type safety and reduces the likelihood of runtime errors
- code clarity
- added intelligence to IDE's
- Tooling support : VS code, Idea, webpack, babel
- TypeScript's features, such as decorators, interfaces, and generics are used in Angular.
